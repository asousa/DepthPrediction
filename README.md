# DepthPrediction
A tool to predict the depth field of a 2-dimensional image based on 
"Deep convolutional neural fields for depth estimation from a single image" by Liu et al.
which can be found [here on arViX](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6387).

The ipython notebooks for the project can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/asousa/DepthPrediction/tree/master/).
